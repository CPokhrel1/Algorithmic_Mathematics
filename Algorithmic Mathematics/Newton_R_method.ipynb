    "### Signal:\n",
    "A signal is typically represented as a function that conveys information. It can be continuous-time or discrete-time, and it may take various forms, such as audio, video, or sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal representation sometimes entails breaking down a signal into a sum or a collection of base functions or simpler functions. Polynomials, sinusoids, wavelets, or other mathematical functions are examples of these base functions. This breakdown enables effective signal analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**weighted sum of polynomials**\n",
    "##### Taylor and Maclaurin series\n",
    "Let us consider a function $f(x+h)$ where h is a small increment (for signals, small noise added to the signal) then we can represent \n",
    "$f(x+h)=A_{0}+A_{1}x+A_{2}x^{2}+A_{3}x^{3}+.....+A_{n}x^{n}$........equation(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "here $A_{i}$ can be constant,can have $h$ terms,but not $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "**or**\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x+h)=A_{0}+A_{1}h+A_{2}h^{2}+A_{3}h^{3}+.....+A_{n}h^{n}$........equation(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $A_{i}$ can be constant, can have $x$ terms, but not $h$ terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To find $A_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Take eqation (1): x=0 and Therefore, $A_{0}=f(h)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{df(x+h)}{dx}= f'(x+h)=A_{1}+2A_{2}x+3A_{3}x^{2}+........+nA_{n}x^{n-1}$\n",

    "**then**\n",
    "\n",

    "$f(x+h)=f(x)+f'(x)h+f''(x)\\frac{h^{2}}{2!}+.......+f^{n}(x)\\frac{h^n}{n!}$.................equation(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation(3) and Equation(4) are called Taylor's series**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Taylor series, a function is represented as an infinite sum of terms, each term being the derivative of the function as it was evaluated at a particular point multiplied by a matching power of the difference between the input value and the point of evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this expansion, a function may be approximated by a polynomial that gets more precise as more terms are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Taylor series derivation is to provide an approximate representation of a function using its derivatives. In order to define the function as a polynomial centered on a particular point a, the function and its derivatives must first be evaluated at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Maclaurin series is a special case of the Taylor series, named after the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. It represents a function as an infinite sum of terms centered around the point x=0**\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)x+f''(0)\\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+f'''(0)\\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+.......+f^{n}(0)\\frac{x^{n}}{n!}$.......equation(5)\n",

    "## Algorithm for Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an initial guess $X_{0}$ for the root of the function $f(x)$\n",
    "2. Set a tolerance value $t_{0}$ to determine the level of accuracy\n",
    "3. Repeat the following steps until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.a. Evaluate the function $f(x)$ and derivative $f'(x)$ at the current estimate $x_{n}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.b. Compute the next estimate $x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\\frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.c. Check if the difference between the current and previous estimates, $|x_{n+1}-x_{n}|$, is less than the tolerance $t_{0}$, If it is, the method has converged, and the current estimate $x_{n+1}$ is considered the root\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.d. Update the current estimate $x_{n}$ to be $x_{n+1}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. If the method does not converge within the maximum number of iterations, consider terminating the process and output an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson approach calculates the subsequent estimate based on the function and its derivative, hence repeatedly improving the root estimate. The method keeps on until the tolerance-determined convergence is reached or up to the allotted number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some major considerations while approaching with Newton-Raphson Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Guess:** The accuracy and convergence of the approach are dependent on the initial root guess. Convergence is improved and the likelihood of convergence to a local minimum or maximum is decreased by selecting an accurate initial guess that is near to the real root. In order to choose a suitable initial estimate, it might be helpful to have knowledge of the behavior of the function and its root.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function and Derivative:** For the Newton-Raphson technique, each iteration must include the computation of the function $f(x)$ and its derivative $fâ€²(x)$. It is crucial to ensure the computation of these values is precise and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence and Divergence:** The Newton-Raphson technique might not always converge or might converge to an unintended root but instead to a local minimum or maximum. Checking the method's convergence behavior for a particular function and starting hunch is crucial. Alternative approaches or changes can be required if the method doesn't converge or behaves erratically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Singularities and Discontinuities:** The Newton-Raphson technique may run into issues when the function or its derivative is close to singularities or discontinuities. It is essential to recognize these situations and respond correctly, which may entail changing the algorithm or choosing different approaches.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example: consider the function $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ This function has a singularity at $x=0$ where it is undefined. If we apply Newton-Raphson method to this point to the function with initial guess $x_{0}=1$ then\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $x_{n+1}=x_{n}-\\frac{\\sqrt{x_{n}}}{{1}/{2\\sqrt{x_{n}}}}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $=2x_{n}-x_{n}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $=x_{n}$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here, we see that the method fails to converge and instead oscillates between the initial guess and the singularity at $x=0$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can change the algorithm to handle these situations or choose different approaches. For instance, if we are aware that a function has a singularity at a particular point, we can choose an initial guess that is far from that point to prevent the singularity. As an alternative, we may make the function or its derivative behave properly close to the singularity, or we can utilize a different root-finding technique that is more appropriate for functions with singularities.\n",

    "### sp.lambdify()\n",
    "The SymPy library, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, offers the function sp.lambdify. It transforms SymPy expressions into callable functions that may be quantitatively evaluated. The lambdify function takes one or more SymPy expressions and creates a lambda function that represents the mathematical expression. \n",

    "The external modules to be utilized are specified by the modules argument, which is an optional parameter. It employs 'numpy' by default, enabling the lambda function to effectively utilise NumPy arrays. If more modules are required, you may additionally specify'math' or'mpmath'.\n",

    "When you use sp.lambdify to turn SymPy expressions into lambda functions, it generates a function that uses the underlying numerical libraries, such NumPy or math, to carry out the mathematical operations indicated in the expression.\n",

    "By using the required input variables and the provided expression, lambdify generates a lambda function that carries out the necessary mathematical operations. To handle operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and other mathematical functions, it makes use of the numerical libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sp.lambdify examines the SymPy expression from the inside out and produces the matching numerical code. The lambda function that may effectively evaluate the expression is then created using the external module that has been supplied (for example, NumPy).\n",
    "For example, if you have an expression like x^2 + sp.sin(y), the lambda function generated by lambdify would use the appropriate mathematical operations and functions from the chosen module (e.g., NumPy) to perform the addition, exponentiation, and sine calculation for the given input values of x and y.\n",

    "Differentiation is carried out via the SymPy sp.diff function using a mix of symbolic manipulation and pattern matching techniques.
